# ai_licia Client

A TypeScript/JavaScript client library for interacting with with [ai_licia AI Co-Host](https://www.getailicia.com) API, allowing you to send context data and trigger reactions from ai_licia in your Twitch stream.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ai_licia-client
```

## Configuration

You can configure the client using environment variables:

```
AI_LICIA_API_URL=https://api.getailicia.com/v1
AI_LICIA_API_KEY=your-api-key
AI_LICIA_CHANNEL=your-channel-name
```

Or you can provide them directly when initializing the client.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { AiliciaClient } from 'ai_licia-client';

// Create a new client
const client = new AiliciaClient(
  'your-api-key',    // Optional, will use environment variable if not provided
  'your-channel',    // Optional, will use environment variable if not provided
  'https://api.getailicia.com/v1'  // Optional, will use environment variable or the default if not provided
);

// Send contextual information to ai_licia (max 700 characters)
await client.sendEvent('Player health: 85%, Position: X:145 Y:230, Kills: 12');

// Trigger an immediate reaction from ai_licia (max 300 characters)
const response = await client.triggerGeneration('Player just defeated the final boss!');
```

## API Reference

### `AiliciaClient`

The main class for interacting with the ai_licia API. ([Official Documentation](https://docs.getailicia.com/publicevents.html))

#### Constructor

```typescript
new AiliciaClient(apiKey?: string, channelName?: string, baseUrl?: string)
```

#### Methods

##### `sendEvent(content: string, ttl?: number): Promise<void>`

Sends contextual information to ai_licia that will be stored in her memory and used for future interactions. This doesn't trigger an immediate response but enriches ai_licia's understanding of what's happening in your stream.

**Use cases:**
- Stream game state (health, position, inventory)
- Current music playing
- Chess board state in ASCII
- Player statistics, progress, or achievements
- Stream milestones
- Your setup state (lights colour, fan active or off, etc)

**Parameters:**
- `content`: The information to send (max 700 characters)
- `ttl`: (Optional) Time-to-live in seconds - how long this information stays relevant

```typescript
// Examples
await client.sendEvent('Current song: "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley');
await client.sendEvent('Chess board: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1');
await client.sendEvent('Player stats: Health: 75/100, Mana: 30/100, Position: Forest of Doom');
```

##### `triggerGeneration(content: string): Promise<GenerationResponse>`

Triggers ai_licia to generate an immediate response to a specific event or moment. This creates a one-off reaction from ai_licia that will appear in your stream.

**Use cases:**
- Player just defeated a boss
- Viewer redeemed channel points for ai_licia to roast them
- Plane crash in a simulator
- Reaching a milestone in-game
- Reaction to a funny/epic moment

**Parameters:**
- `content`: What ai_licia should react to (max 300 characters)

```typescript
// Examples
await client.triggerGeneration('Player just pulled a legendary sword from the stone!');
await client.triggerGeneration('Viewer "GameMaster42" redeemed points for an ai_licia roast');
await client.triggerGeneration('Plane crashed into the mountain. Total damage: $2.5M');
```


## Error Handling

The client throws descriptive errors when API calls fail. You can catch these errors to handle them gracefully:

```typescript
try {
  await client.sendEvent('Player entered the final dungeon');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to send event:', error.message);
}
```

Common errors:
- Content length exceeding limits (700 chars for events, 300 chars for generations)
- API key authorization issues
- Rate limiting (too many requests)

## Environment Setup

You can use environment variables with dotenv by creating a `.env` file:

```
AI_LICIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AI_LICIA_CHANNEL=your_twitch_channel_name
```

Then in your code:

```typescript
import { AiliciaClient } from 'ai_licia-client';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Load environment variables
dotenv.config();

// Create client using environment variables
const client = new AiliciaClient();

// Now you can use client.sendEvent() and client.triggerGeneration()
```
